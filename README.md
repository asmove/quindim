# Robotics4fun

This is a homemade robotics library made using well-known literature on Robotics like the authors Craig and the course of Control and automation of Univrsity of Sao Paulo. Don't trust it much! It is a big WIP and contributions are welcome. In case you are 
interested on a more mature material, take a look at http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox :)

If you are willing to use it, before calling the functions, type no MATLAB shell

```addpath('$ROB4FUN_PATH')```

where $ROB4FUN_PATH stands for the path where you cloned the repository.

Have fun and may the force be with you.
