# Robotics4fun

This is a homemade robotics library made using trustworthy literature on Robotics. However, don't trust it much, it is a WIP and contributions are welcome. In case you are interested on a more mature material, take a look at http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox :)

# Installation

If you are willing to use it, follow the instructions:

1) Open Matlab up to the version 2015x, x = a, b;
2) Before calling the functions, type on MATLAB shell 

```
addpath('$ROB4FUN_PATH')
addpath(genpath('$ROB4FUN_PATH'))
savepath
``` 

where ```$ROB4FUN_PATH``` stands for the path where you cloned the repository, ```addpath``` add the provided path to ```MATLABPATH``` and ```genpath``` generate all paths of subfolders within ```$ROB4FUN_PATH```.


3) Have fun and may the force be with you.
