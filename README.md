# Robotics4fun

This is a homemade robotics library made using well-known literature on Robotics with thustworthy literature. Don't trust it much, it is a WIP and contributions are welcome. In case you are interested on a more mature material, take a look at http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox :)

# Installation

If you are willing to use it, follow the instructions:

1) Open Matlab up to the version 2015x, x = a, b;
2) Before calling the functions, type on MATLAB shell ```addpath('$ROB4FUN_PATH')``` where ```$ROB4FUN_PATH``` stands for the path where you cloned the repository.
3) Have fun and may the force be with you.
